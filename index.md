# About

The half-day workshop will be held at CVPR2023 and will provide a forum for presenting original research in computer vision and photogrammetry including the generation, processing, and analysis of images, 3D point clouds and surface models, with the goal of enhancing accuracy and completeness. PCV 2023 invites submissions of high-quality research results as full papers in the format of CVPR 2023. Topics include, but are not limited to: 
* Feature extraction, matching, and sensor orientation and sensor fusion 
* Structure from motion and SLAM
* Stereo (multi-view) and surface reconstruction
* 3D point cloud processing, segmentation, and classification
* Multi-temporal analysis, dynamic scene understanding 
* 3D scene analysis and semantic segmentation 

We especially encourage submissions that combine traditional P/CV with modern deep learning methods.
